The size of the circles and darkness indicates the relative number of trips started at those locations. It is apparent that the bulk of the bike trips are originating in the bustling commercial district of Lower Manhattan. Bike usage is lower in the less densely packed surrounding neighborhoods.

## Summary
The data shows high activity of the bike sharing service in New York during the month of August 2019, particular more evident in Manhattan area. Males riders who have a subscription tend to use the bike share services most often. Thursday, Friday, and Saturdays are the most favorable days, with evening hours showing most usage during weekdays, and lunchtime during the weekends.
The far majority of the rides were in the very busy Manhattan Island, taken by male users during morning and evening rush hours. This implies that Citi Bike services are used as an alternative to public transportation by commuting workers.

Additional analysis that would be beneficial is to compare data for different months to determine seasonal trends across the year. Another analysis recommendation would be dive more into female users and look for correlations between age (birth year), and location of start and stop stations to help determine factor to increase female usage of the bikeshare program.
